      <h2>My Career Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Having been exposed to Computer Science for 2 years and having completed
        an internship this summer. I have a better idea of where I want to take
        my career to go and I seem to enjoy networking and security. So I will
        be hoping to get an internship in that field this summer.

        <h3>internship Experience</h3>
        <p>
          My internship this summer was as a <b>Network Engineer</b> with General
          Dynamics in San Diego. I got to learn and play around with systems
          severs, switches, firewalls etc.
